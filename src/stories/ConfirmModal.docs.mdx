The `confirmModal` is a lightweight, framework-agnostic utility for displaying confirmation dialogs.
It works natively with Web Components and can be called from anywhere using a simple JavaScript function.

# Usage

```js
import { openModal } from '@brightsg/bright-ui';

const confirmed = await confirmModal({
    title: 'Delete client',
    description: 'Are you sure you want to delete this client?',
});

if (confirmed) {
    console.log('Client deleted');
}
```
